# Introduction

When adding a cookie consent dialog to a website, developers are usually faced with 2 options:

1. Use an existing cookie consent banner, which is usually hard to customise.
2. Create your own with the features and style you need, but you have to implement everything yourself.

This package aims to solve the problem of choosing between the two half-solutions by providin you with a hook that handles all the logic, and leaves you to implement the user interface.
